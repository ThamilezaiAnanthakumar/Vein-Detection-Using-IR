## 🛠️ How It Works  

- The system uses an **ESP32-CAM module** to capture real-time images.  
- Images are streamed wirelessly to a browser via Wi-Fi.  
- A **circular LED array** enhances visibility for detecting veins.  
- The built-in **ESP32 camera web server** enables live streaming.

## 💡 Why We Chose the ESP32-CAM  

For this project, we opted for the **ESP32-CAM module** due to second-semester restrictions requiring:  
- Custom PCB design.  
- Soldering for the hardware setup.  

This approach fulfilled the requirements but resulted in lower image quality, a limitation we plan to address in future iterations.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

To improve the system, we propose:  
1. **Using a Raspberry Pi and NoIR Camera** for better image quality.  
2. **Applying Edge Detection Techniques** to clearly outline veins.  

These enhancements would significantly improve the clarity and usability of the system.
