The repository includes:

1. Code files: Arduino code for TFT display.
   
2. PCB files: Schematic and PCB layout design files that outline the hardware setup and connections for the vein detection system.

3. Enclosure files: 3D model files and design files for the physical enclosure .

4. Final report: Includes a description of the task, design diagrams, simulation and testing methodologies, results, strategies used for optimizing resource consumption, and additional features. The report will also cover resource utilization, contributions of team members, and instructions for practical operation.

The ESP32 camera captures real-time images, which are transmitted wirelessly to a browser, enabling users to detect veins through Wi-Fi access.We used built-in ESP32 camerwebserver code for livestreaming the vein  through wifi
